# dayz
A repo to enable the kind people of Reddit to troubleshoot my Dayz server issues.

## Things to note

The `logs` directory is from the dayz server `profile` directory

My steam username has been redacted from the batch files, replace it with your own.

## Using this repo
To replicate my build process:

 * create a `dayz` directory in the `Documents` directory of the logged in user.
 * Copy the contents of the `template1` directory into the newly created `dayz` directory.  
 * Copy the batch files in the `dayz` directory.
 * Execute `install_melkart.bat`
 * Execute `start_melkart.bat`
