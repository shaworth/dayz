Troubleshooting Dayz server issues

The batch files are located in the directory `%UserProfile%\Documents\dayz`
`template1` is a subdirectory of `%UserProfile%\Documents\dayz`
The `logs` directory is from the dayz server `profile` directory

My steam username has been redacted, replace it with your own.

# Using this repo
To replicate my build process:

 * create a `dayz` directory in the `Documents` directory of the logged in user.
 * Copy the contents of the `template1` directory into the newly created `dayz` directory.  
 * Copy the three batch files in the `dayz` directory.
 * Execute `install_melkart.bat`
 * Execute `start_melkart.bat`
